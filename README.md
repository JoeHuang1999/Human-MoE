# Human-MoE: Multimodal Full-Body Human Image Synthesis with Component-driven Mixture of Experts
Yu-Jiu Huang and I-Chen Lin
## Description
This repository provides the PyTorch implementation of the paper "Human-MoE: Multimodal Full-Body Human Image Synthesis with Component-driven Mixture of Experts".
## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 or Windows 11
- CUDA version 11.6 or later
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
### Installation
1. Create and activate the virtual environment.
```
conda create -n ldm python=3.9
conda activate ldm
```
2. Install the packages.
```
cd Human-MoE
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```
## Datasets
### [DeepFashion-MultiModal](https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal)
We use the dataset preprocessed by [Text2Human](https://github.com/yumingj/Text2Human) as the starting point.
The background from the ground truth images will be removed and placed into ```./data/no-bg-train-images``` and ```./data/no-bg-test-images```, respectively.
Parsing maps are stored in ```./data/masks```, pose maps are extracted using OpenPose and saved in ```./data/skeletons```, and captions are obtained via the Gemini API and placed in ```./data/captions```.
Binary masks are generated by labeling segmentation based on parsing maps and placed in ```./data/binary-masks```.

For the experts dataset, ground truth images undergo the following processing: A fine-tuned YOLO V9 model detects face and hand BBOXes, cropping them to 128×128, while upper and lower clothing BBOXes are extracted from the parsing map and resized to 256×256.
